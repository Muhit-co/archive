# Muhit Archive
https://muhit.co

Gatsby repository for Muhit Idea Archive.

Based on Gatsby's [My Hello World Starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world)

### Build & Deploy
Deployment happens through Netlify; when pushing new commits to `master` branch, Netlify will try and build and deploy the latest version.

### Development
For development, run `yarn` to install dependencies, `yarn dev` to run a development instance and `yarn build` to run a local build.
